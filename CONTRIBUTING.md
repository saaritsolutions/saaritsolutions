# Contributing to SaarIT Solutions Repositories

We welcome contributions from all team members and collaborators.  
Please follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and quality across all SaarIT projects.

## 💻 Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository (if external) or create a new branch (if internal).
2. Use an appropriate branch name:
   - `feature/<feature-name>`
   - `bugfix/<bug-description>`
   - `hotfix/<issue>`
3. Make your changes locally and commit using [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) standards.
4. Push your changes and open a **Pull Request** (PR) to the `main` or relevant feature branch.
5. Ensure:
   - Code passes linting/tests
   - Descriptive PR title and message
   - Linked issues (if applicable)

## 🔍 Code Reviews

- At least **one reviewer approval** is required before merging.
- Reviewers check for:
  - Code readability and maintainability
  - Security and performance implications
  - Adherence to project conventions

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Write unit and integration tests where applicable.
- Use test coverage tools to ensure adequate testing.
- Pass all automated CI tests before requesting a merge.

---

## 🚫 Don’t

- Push directly to `main` or `release` branches.
- Commit hard-coded secrets or credentials.
- Use vague commit messages like "fixed stuff" or "updated code".

---

## 📦 Merging

- Only leads or reviewers may merge PRs.
- Use **Squash and Merge** for a clean history (unless otherwise agreed).
