## 4.1 Functional Modules & Customization

| Module | Purpose | Customization Method | Tech Stack |
|--------|---------|----------------------|------------|
| **Customer Management** | Onboarding, KYC, risk scoring | KYC templates, rule designer | .NET Web API, Angular forms, PostgreSQL JSONB |
| **Account Management** | Manage account types, states | Config-driven product schema | Entity Framework + Table-per-Hierarchy |
| **Product Engine** | Loan/savings product modeling | No-code product builder UI | Angular dynamic form builder, config-driven .NET services |
| **Pricing & Fees** | Define interest, tiered pricing | Matrix-based fee configurator | Angular grid UI, rule evaluator in C# |
| **Workflow Engine** | Manage flows (e.g., account opening) | Drag-and-drop visual editor | BPMN.js (Angular), .NET Camunda-compatible executor |
| **Rules Engine** | Decision rules (e.g., approvals) | Visual rule builder (IF/ELSE) | Rule engine like [NRules](https://github.com/NRules/NRules) |
| **Ledger Engine** | Transactions and posting | Configurable chart of accounts | .NET DDD aggregates, PostgreSQL |
| **Notifications** | Emails, SMS, push | Template + trigger-based config | Angular template editor, .NET event bus |
| **Security & Access** | Roles, permissions, RBAC/PBAC | Role/branch/country matrix | ASP.NET Identity + Policy-based auth |
| **Integrations** | KYC, credit bureau, tax APIs | Plug-in API designer | Swagger-first plug-and-play connectors |
| **Reports & Analytics** | Operational and regulatory reporting | Drag-drop report builder | Angular report designer, .NET FastReport |
| **Localization** | Language, time zone, regional rules | Config bundle per locale | ngx-translate, .NET i18n middlewares |

## 4.2 Key Compatible Components

| Function | Tool / Library | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Rule Engine | **NRules** (.NET) | Strong forward-chaining business rule engine |
| Workflow Engine | **Camunda 8 (via REST)** or **Elsa Workflows** (.NET-native) | BPMN and human workflows |
| Feature Flags | **FeatureToggle** / **LaunchDarkly** / Custom DB flags | Tenant + country specific control |
| UI Config / Forms | **ngx-formly** (Angular) | Dynamic forms from JSON |
| Report Builder | **FastReport.NET**, **Stimulsoft** | Designers for business users |
| API Gateway | **Ocelot** (.NET), **Azure API Management** | Multi-tenant API management |
| Configuration Store | PostgreSQL (JSONB) + EF | Tenant/Country scoped app config |
| No-Code Admin UI | Angular + Monaco Editor (for rule editing) | Browser-based customization UX |
| Deployment | Azure DevOps, Docker, Helm (if using containers) | Environment management |

## 4.3 Configuration Strategy

| Config Layer | Description | Storage Mechanism |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Global Defaults** | Platform-wide rules and settings | JSONB in PostgreSQL |
| **Country Configs** | Currency, KYC, holidays, formats | Hierarchical override structure |
| **Tenant (Bank) Configs** | Product catalog, fees, branding | Scoped by tenant ID |
| **Branch Overrides** | Operational limits, approval thresholds | Branch ID filter |
| **UI Layout & Fields** | Custom forms per product | Angular-driven schema model |

## 4.4 Example: Configure a New Savings Product for Kenya

| Step | Action | No-Code Interface |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Define savings product | Product builder UI |
| 2 | Set interest slabs | Tiered pricing matrix |
| 3 | Enable mobile onboarding | Workflow editor |
| 4 | Configure KYC provider (local) | API connector UI |
| 5 | Set compliance rules | Rule designer |
| 6 | Launch to test tenant | Environment switcher |

---

## 4.5 Governance & Change Control

| Mechanism | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Config versioning | PostgreSQL with config ID & timestamp |
| Audit logs | ASP.NET Action Filters + Serilog |
| Preview sandbox | Staging DB + dynamic config loader |
| Role-based access | ASP.NET Identity + Angular route guards |
| Approval workflows | Workflow engine w/ maker-checker BPMN |

---

## 4.6 Observability & Debugging

| Area | Tooling |
|------|---------|
| Logs | Serilog + Seq |
| API Tracing | OpenTelemetry + Jaeger |
| Rule Evaluation Logs | Middleware logger in rule engine |
| Config History | Git-like diff view in admin portal |
